   abstract = {Recent advances in food insecurity classification have made analytical approaches to predict and inform response to food crises possible. This paper develops a predictive, statistical framework to identify drivers of food insecurity risk with simulation capabilities for scenario analyses, risk assessment and forecasting purposes. It utilizes a panel vector-autoregression to model food insecurity distributions of 15 countries between October 2009 and February 2019. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) methods are employed to identify the most important agronomic, weather, conflict and economic variables. The paper finds that food insecurity dynamics are asymmetric and past-dependent, with low insecurity states more likely to transition to high insecurity states than vice versa. Conflict variables are more relevant for highly critical states, while agronomic and weather variables are more important for less critical states. Food prices are predictive for all cases. A Bayesian extension is introduced to incorporate expert opinions through the use of priors, which can lead to significant improvements in model performance.},

   abstract = {It is important to make a distinction between data gathering (which is in the scope of the IPC), and data generation (which is outside the scope of the IPC per se, and is reliant on partner organization efforts and other sources). [...] Data Sharing 10 Data sharing refers to the ability of the IPC data management systems (i.e., the ISS in its current form and in the future) to be able to automatically share key data/information nuggets with other systems both within the IPC (e.g., the communication system) and external to the IPC (e.g., with partner organizations). [...] However, with both the emergence of new technologies and data sources as well as the increased global pressures to have more timely and complete global coverage of food security analysis, the ATARI initiative has identified a number of technologies which have potential to make the consensus building process more efficient as well as to potentially automate some or all aspects of the analysis. [...] Priority Technologies for integration in IPC This section describes the identification of immediate and longer-term opportunities for improving the IPC focusing on technologies that respond to the priority needs of analysts including data management and data analyses. [...] Identification for priority technologies to be integrated in IPC is based on: 1) the potential value of the technology for the IPC, and 2) the likely complexity of implementation (see Graph 1 for a mapping of these technologies and Section III for a more detailed description of each).},

   abstract = {Globally, over 800 million people are food insecure. Current methods for identifying food insecurity crises are not based on statistical models and fail to systematically incorporate readily available data on prices, weather, and demographics. As a result, policymakers cannot rapidly identify food insecure populations. These problems delay responses to mitigate hunger. We develop a replicable, near real-time model incorporating spatially and temporally granular market data, remotely-sensed rainfall and geographic data, and demographic characteristics. We train the model on 2010–2011 data from Malawi and forecast 2013 food security. Our model correctly identifies the food security status of 83 to 99% of the most food insecure village clusters in 2013, depending on the food security measure, while the prevailing approach correctly identifies between 0 and 10%. Our results show the power of modeling food insecurity to provide early warning and suggest model-driven approaches could dramatically improve food insecurity crisis response.},
