			<h4>Introduction</h4>
			<p>
				One of the global challenges we are facing currently is food insecurity: over 258 million people face
				acute food insecurity, requiring urgent food, nutrition and livelihood assistance. These numbers have
				been growing in the past years due to climate change, conflicts and soaring food prices due to COVID-19
				and the war in Ukraine.
			</p>
			<p>
				To which extent different countries are suffering from this condition is assessed by the Integrated Food
				Security Phase Classification (IPC). These assessments are of high importance as they inform
				humanitarian organizations where they should send their aid to. Moreover, given the scarcity of
				humanitarian funds it is essential that these assessments are as accurate as possible: underestimating
				the problem results in unnecessary deaths and hardships, while overestimating it diverts limited
				humanitarian resources away from areas with greater needs.
			</p>
			<p>
				The IPC utilizes an evidence-based consensus process to classify the extent of food insecurity within a
				country and identify the underlying factors driving it. This process relies on experts with extensive
				knowledge of the country's context and food security dynamics. This not only ensures that the results
				are backed up by causal factors that can be addressed, but also that the outcomes will be supported by
				sufficient important stakeholders within the country.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, as building technical consensus takes a considerable amount of resources in terms of time and
				data gathering, this process is performed only once or twice a year. As such, this gives much room for
				FI situations to change in the meantime, making it hard for organizations to act on what the current FI
				situation actually demands. The IPC does make projections on what the FI situation will look like 3 to 6
				months in the future, but these projections only work with the most-likely scenario and are based on
				assumptions that may not retain their validity throughout the time in between assessments. Therefore, we
				propose to develop a tool that monitors whether the predicted FI scenarios in-between FI analyses still
				hold by assessing whether the assumptions underlying the predictions remain valid. This tool would then
				serve as a warning system that could be used by the IPC to discover when an analysis needs to be redone
				to account for the changed circumstances. Moreover, by formalising the assumptions underlying the
				assessments, our tool could facilitate an unambiguous interpretation of the scenarios that could be used
				in different countries.
			</p>
			<p>
				Given the increasing urgency of this problem and the availability of new data sources, there have been
				numerous attempts in recent years at using different forms of machine learning to predict Food
				Insecurity classifications for countries. These models have been developed in isolation from the IPC
				consensus process and would function as a replacement of the consensus process rather than an
				enhancement. However, given the high-risk and context-sensitive nature of food insecurity, we believe
				that it is not possible to replace expert assessments with a complete data-driven model and should not
				be strived for. Instead, we rather see the value of using modelling in clarifying and enhancing the
				current analysis process. Our research will therefore not solely be an opportunity-driven project where
				we develop a machine-learning model that predicts food insecurity, but a project that starts with
				investigating how the current process works and where a computer model could provide additional insights
				to the people leading this process. Following this line, we have chosen to structure our project
				according to human-centred design principles, where in each phase the feedback of its intended users is
				guiding for the further development of the model. See below our research questions and research plan for
				more details.</p>

			<h4>Research question:</h4>
			<p class="quote">"How can <a href="https://computersciencewiki.org/index.php/Computer_modeling">computer
				modeling</a> methods aid in monitoring the validity of projected Food
				Insecurity scenarios by predicting whether the underlying assumptions for these scenarios still
				hold?"</p>
			<div>We will answer the main question by exploring these subquestions:</div>
			<div id="rq-list"></div>
		</div>
		<div class="col-12">
			<h4>Research plan:</h4>
			<div>We have developed a research plan following the lines of human-centered design. The plan is therefore
				structured in four phases where we diverge and converge in each phase to develop the deliverables as
				defined below.
				The global planning for the following phases is:
				<ul>
					<li>From May until begin September: Clarify & Ideate</li>
					<li>From July until December: Develop & Implement</li>
				</ul>
				As indicated by the planning, the execution periods of the phases will partly overlap with each other as
				insights from one phase will influence the outcomes of other phases.
