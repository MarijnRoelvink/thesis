			<h4>Abstract</h4>
			<p>Climate change is increasingly affecting food insecurity (FI) worldwide, rendering numerous countries more susceptible to this issue. Therefore, it is crucial to accurately assess the FI situation in different countries so scarce humanitarian resources can be allocated appropiately. To this end, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), who is responsible for making these assessments, is striving to increase the scale and frequency of their assessments. Currently IPC analyses are performed once or twice a year for a specific country, leaving ample room for changes to occur in the meantime that invalidate the previously predicted FI scenarios. To address this, we propose to develop a monitoring tool that can signal throughout the year whether IPC assessments need to be reevaluated. Such a tool will enable humanitarian response to be better tailored to the current demands of the situation. In contrast to other data-driven research on modelling and predicting FI, we follow a human-centered design process where the practices and needs within the organization are leading for the development of our monitoring tool. By doing so, we ensure that our research answers the right problem and is made to fit within the existing structures of the IPC.</p>

			<h4>Research question:</h4>
			<p class="quote"><i>How can data-driven modelling methods aid in monitoring the validity of projected Food Insecurity scenarios by predicting whether the underlying assumptions for these scenarios still hold?</i></p>
			<div>We will answer the main question by exploring these subquestions:</div>
			<div id="rq-list"></div>
		</div>
		<div class="col-12">
			<h4>Research plan:</h4>
			<div>We have developed a research plan following the lines of human-centered design. The plan is therefore structured in four phases where we diverge and converge in each phase to develop the deliverables as defined below.
				The global planning for the following phases is:
				<ul>
					<li>From May until begin September: Clarify & Ideate</li>
					<li>From July until December: Develop & Implement</li>
				</ul>
				As indicated by the planning, the execution periods of the phases will partly overlap with each other as insights from one phase will influence the outcomes of other phases.
